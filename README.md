# Leaderex Agenda (Unofficial)

## What

I wanted to plan the sessions I would attend at this conference called [Leaderex](http://www.leaderex.com/), but I didn't find the agenda on the website user friendly. So I thought I could make it the way I would like it:
- Place with all the sessions in order
- Some filtering to make it easier
- Something quick and easy to save the sessions I want to go to (NB, this is just local storage so per device)

**This was super quick so I'm sure there will be bugs and spelling mistakes, use at own risk**

## Code

There are 2 folders:
- scrape - where I scrape the agenda using puppeteer 
- website - using gastby where I'm using the data from the puppeteer script to show the agenda
